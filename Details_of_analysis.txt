MY APPROACH
Data Processing and Visualization
1. Data Loading and Preprocessing:
    ✓ Extract only the rows where type is impedance.
    ✓ Ensure columns like Re and Rct are numerical.
    ✓ Add a sequential cycle_count column based on the experiment's temporal progression.
2. Filtering the Relevant Data:
    ✓ Filter rows with type = "impedance" since only those have values for Re and Rct.
    ✓ Verify and clean the Re and Rct columns, handling missing or non-numerical values.
3. Plotting with Plotly:
    ✓ Use Plotly Express to create line plots showing:
        ▪ Re vs. cycle_count.
        ▪ Rct vs. cycle_count
